defmodule AssignWhen do

  Allows the use of 'when' clauses on assignment statements as an alternative to using 'if',
  avoiding the need for boilerplate 'else' clauses which return the original variables when
  the condition is 'false'. Eg:

  `x = 1 when x == nil`

  can replace

  `x = if x == nil, do: 1, else: x`
