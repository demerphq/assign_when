# AssignWhen

Allows the use of `when` clauses on assignment statements as an alternative to using `if`,
avoiding the need for boilerplate `else` clauses which return the original variables when
the condition is `false`.

Statements like this:

```elixir
x = if condition(), do: whatever, else: x
```

can be replaced with code like this:

```elixir
x = whatever when condition()
```

For instance you can write

```elixir
x = 1 when x == nil
```

Exports no functions, just a macro. The macro does no validation,
but it does work on tuples and anything else that can be expressed
as THING = THING
